# Joseph Yun and Mitch Cutts

As of June 8th, Joseph and I have met for 39 hours.

Here is a summary of our work so far:

### Learning Python

Joseph and I spent the first 6 weeks learning python, markdown, functions, and some modules. You can see our work in the [python-introduction](./python-introduction) folder. This involved ten exercises and three homeworks. 

### Pandas, Numpy, Data Analytics
Joseph then learned the basics of data science by conducting an exploratory data analysis on the Titanic Dataset. You can find this work in the [pandas_project](./pandas-project) folder.

### Supervised Machine Learning
We then took our work on the titanic dataset one step further by training 3 supervised machine learning models on our titanic data, following SKLearns machine learning pipeline. You can find this work in the [pandas_project](./pandas-project) folder. We also learned how to evaluate SML models and iterate to improve them empirically.

### Computer Vision using Tensorflow
Joseph wanted to learn about supervision next as we began to explore his interests for NLP. We learned about "Plain Vanilla" Neural Networks (multilayer perceptrons), then learned about Convolutional Neural Networks. You can find this work in the [computer vision](./Computer_Vision) folder  At this point, we had enough background to build our first end to end product.

### End-To-End Product
Our end to end product is a web app that is mobile-friendly. It begins with a simple programming concept: allowing a user to play a rock-paper-scissors game with a computer. What makes this game special is the computer is able to recognize the user's guess with computer vision -- it can actually look at the sign on their hand and predict what sign they make.

*Technical Components:* <br>
Python - PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, PIL, OpenCV, Requests, Flask. <br>
Flask Backend <br>
YOLOv5 Object Detection Model <br>
HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/CustomJS <br>
Cloud Development - Google Colab and Jupyter Notebooks <br>
<br>

### What's Next:
Now that we have built an end-to-end product, Joseph and I will be exploring his interests. He is very interested in the medical field so we are have just started working with COVID data and will likely build a dashboard or EDA notebook github page.  <br>

Joseph has shown great interest for programming in the medical field, so we can explore applications of computer vision (X-Ray detection, Cancer Classification), Data Science (heart disease EDA, COVID EDA), or natural language processing (sequence processing).
